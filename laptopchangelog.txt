Configs:

- Re-enabled HCFishing because I can control features I don't want.
- If HCLumber is enabled, do I want to disable/remove bark? Or should I integrate that with Pyrotech? - Pyrotech does NOT have Bark.

- Changed boats to not require wooden shovel or override boat recipe, to allow Pyrotech's boat to be the only recipe. Also because of the wooden shovel being disabled.

=====Commit 3 [12/11/19]=====
Configs:
- Edited splash.properties (but it needs further editing)
- Unsure if I want BWM HCHunger or not. Currently leaving it enabled, because it could be interesting to balance nutrition values with getting fat.
- Disabled HCHunting because with the amount of hostile mobs in the world, keeping a farm would become untenable.
- Disabled HCJumping because it seems like it'd interfere with cases it's not meant to.
- Disabled HCMobEquipment for now, because I think that's meant to make mobs not wear diamond armor etc.

=====Commit 2 [12/10/19]=====
Configs:
- Disabled "HarderSteelRecipe" as I don't want to put heavy focus on the End.
- Disabled Nether Growth Spores because I don't think nether mob farms are going to be crucial to the pack and I don't want it interfering with BetterNether.

- Disabled Reduced Debug info because it was driving me nuts.
- Disabled Conversion Recipes for the miniblocks because they're not needed.
- Disabled the removal of crafting grid recipes that include items ground up in the mill ("Grinding Only").
- Disabled "ExplosiveRecipes" - hellfire recipes in cauldron/crucible would cause explosions if stoked.
- Disabled the inability to sleep.
- Disabled HCBuckets for now because I don't think I will bother with water control.

- Disable HCCooking because it doesn't seem to be working, and also I'm not sure I want it anyway.
- Disable HCDeadweight because the Infernal Enchanter seems too much work.
- Disabled HCDiamond because I didn't want the tool changes. However, I plan to use the Diamond Alloy for something - maybe a few for armor or something?
- Disabled the HCInfo reduced debug info because I hated it.
- Changed vanilla diamond behavior w/ dropt. When mined with a pickaxe lower than diamond, only shards (1-5) drop. When mined with a diamond or higher pickaxe, there is a 10% chance (fortune-affected) of getting a diamond ingot as well as normal diamond.


Scripts:
- Disabled BWM Diamond nuggets.

- Changed the spoilage time for spider eyes.
- Changed the spoilage time for all salted foods, plus XLFM's butter.
- Disabled spoilage for SaltyMod's jarred foods and Corned Beef.
