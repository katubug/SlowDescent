Changelog

Pre-Beta:
=====Commit 3 [12/11/19]=====
Configs:
- Edited splash.properties (but it needs further editing)
- Unsure if I want BWM HCHunger or not. Currently leaving it enabled, because it could be interesting to balance nutrition values with getting fat.
- Disabled HCHunting because with the amount of hostile mobs in the world, keeping a farm would become untenable.
- Disabled HCJumping because it seems like it'd interfere with cases it's not meant to.
- Disabled HCMobEquipment for now, because I think that's meant to make mobs not wear diamond armor etc.
- Disabled HCOres because I don't want that feature.
- Changed HCSaw to false because I don't want to lock doors etc behind machinery.
- Disabled HCSpawn because losing time thanks to death should be punishment enough.
- Disabled HCStumping because I don't want the leather processing (so don't need bark).
- Disabled HCTorches.
- HCStructures - kept recipes enabled for vanilla items, reduced "looted" distance to 700 from 2000.
- Altered some of the smelting times for items to make them slightly less hardcore.

Scripts:
- Remove non-nethercoal torch recipes

=====Commit 2 [12/10/19]=====
Configs:
- Disabled "HarderSteelRecipe" as I don't want to put heavy focus on the End.
- Disabled Nether Growth Spores because I don't think nether mob farms are going to be crucial to the pack and I don't want it interfering with BetterNether.
- Added purified water to the water wheel liquids. I don't foresee anyone doing that but eh.
- Disabled Reduced Debug info because it was driving me nuts.
- Disabled Conversion Recipes for the miniblocks because they're not needed.
- Disabled the removal of crafting grid recipes that include items ground up in the mill ("Grinding Only").
- Disabled "ExplosiveRecipes" - hellfire recipes in cauldron/crucible would cause explosions if stoked.
- Disabled the inability to sleep.
- Disabled HCBuckets for now because I don't think I will bother with water control.
- Disabled HCCobblestone because Pyrotech overrides it anyway.
- Disable HCCooking because it doesn't seem to be working, and also I'm not sure I want it anyway.
- Disable HCDeadweight because the Infernal Enchanter seems too much work.
- Disabled HCDiamond because I didn't want the tool changes. However, I plan to use the Diamond Alloy for something - maybe a few for armor or something?
- Disabled the HCInfo reduced debug info because I hated it.
- Changed vanilla diamond behavior w/ dropt. When mined with a pickaxe lower than diamond, only shards (1-5) drop. When mined with a diamond or higher pickaxe, there is a 10% chance (fortune-affected) of getting a diamond ingot as well as normal diamond.


Scripts:
- Disabled BWM Diamond nuggets.
- Edited BWM Diamond Ingots to use Pyrotech Diamond Shards instead of nuggets in stoked crucible. Ingot recipe w/ iron and creeper oysters is untouched.

- Pyrotech campfire now gives off heat.
- PVJ Bones when mined, give bone shards from Pyrotech.
- PVJ ground cover rocks mine into Pyrotech rocks.
- PVJ Mystical Grill has been disabled.
- BWM Bonemeal option has been disabled, to allow Compost to apply bonemeal affect.
- BWM potion brewing options disabled, but it's not a well-researched decision.
- BWM HC fishing turned off because bait seems too much work.
- BWM HC gloom disabled because I don't want the damage effects in darkness, and the "sanity" mechanic is already taken care of.
- BWM, reenabled the removal of the Bone Meal crafting grid recipe. I think it might be overwritten by pyrotech anyway, but eh.
- Changed the spoilage time for spider eyes.
- Changed the spoilage time for all salted foods, plus XLFM's butter.
- Disabled spoilage for SaltyMod's jarred foods and Corned Beef.

Scripts:
