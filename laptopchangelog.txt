=====Commit 6 [12/13/19]=====
Configs:
- Made Blooms produce ingots instead of nuggets via the core.compat.Ore-Custom file. Hopefully only that (docs say it's fine).
- Adjusted TaN's weather and season modifiers and the max amount of temperature that can change per turnover. Hopefully this will make it still challenging, but less punishing. I didn't change how often the temperature tries to change.
- Changed the length of each subseason from 7 to 4.
- Nerfed some handheld light sources (redstone and gold).

- Altered Diamond Armor recipes to use some Ingots instead of all gems.

=====Commit 4 [12/12/19]=====
Configs:
- Enabled BWM kid friendly option to see what it does.
- Re-enabled HCFishing because I can control features I don't want.
- If HCLumber is enabled, do I want to disable/remove bark? Or should I integrate that with Pyrotech? - Pyrotech does NOT have Bark.
- Customized some of the hunger/fatness penalties
- Changed boats to not require wooden shovel or override boat recipe, to allow Pyrotech's boat to be the only recipe. Also because of the wooden shovel being disabled.

- Changed normal and semi-abandoned village radiuses to be less far out. Disabled all villagers being nitwits.
- Disabled the need for path-making shovels to be better than stone.
- Altered some of the penalties for injury. Players can attack for longer, but lose mobility faster.

- Zombies don't have 100% chance to drop their gear.
- Disabled Explosion Tracker because singleplayer only.
- Disabled some Kiln stuff.

=====Commit 3 [12/11/19]=====
Configs:
- Edited splash.properties (but it needs further editing)
- Unsure if I want BWM HCHunger or not. Currently leaving it enabled, because it could be interesting to balance nutrition values with getting fat.
- Disabled HCHunting because with the amount of hostile mobs in the world, keeping a farm would become untenable.
- Disabled HCJumping because it seems like it'd interfere with cases it's not meant to.
- Disabled HCMobEquipment for now, because I think that's meant to make mobs not wear diamond armor etc.
- Disabled HCOres because I don't want that feature.
- Changed HCSaw to false because I don't want to lock doors etc behind machinery.
- Disabled HCSpawn because losing time thanks to death should be punishment enough.
- Disabled HCStumping because I don't want the leather processing (so don't need bark).
- Disabled HCTorches.
- HCStructures - kept recipes enabled for vanilla items, reduced "looted" distance to 700 from 2000.
- Altered some of the smelting times for items to make them slightly less hardcore.

Scripts:
- Remove non-nethercoal torch recipes

=====Commit 2 [12/10/19]=====
Configs:
- Disabled "HarderSteelRecipe" as I don't want to put heavy focus on the End.
- Disabled Nether Growth Spores because I don't think nether mob farms are going to be crucial to the pack and I don't want it interfering with BetterNether.
- Added purified water to the water wheel liquids. I don't foresee anyone doing that but eh.
- Disabled Reduced Debug info because it was driving me nuts.
- Disabled Conversion Recipes for the miniblocks because they're not needed.
- Disabled the removal of crafting grid recipes that include items ground up in the mill ("Grinding Only").
- Disabled "ExplosiveRecipes" - hellfire recipes in cauldron/crucible would cause explosions if stoked.
- Disabled the inability to sleep.
- Disabled HCBuckets for now because I don't think I will bother with water control.
- Disabled HCCobblestone because Pyrotech overrides it anyway.
- Disable HCCooking because it doesn't seem to be working, and also I'm not sure I want it anyway.
- Disable HCDeadweight because the Infernal Enchanter seems too much work.
- Disabled HCDiamond because I didn't want the tool changes. However, I plan to use the Diamond Alloy for something - maybe a few for armor or something?
- Disabled the HCInfo reduced debug info because I hated it.
- Changed vanilla diamond behavior w/ dropt. When mined with a pickaxe lower than diamond, only shards (1-5) drop. When mined with a diamond or higher pickaxe, there is a 10% chance (fortune-affected) of getting a diamond ingot as well as normal diamond.


Scripts:
- Disabled BWM Diamond nuggets.
- Edited BWM Diamond Ingots to use Pyrotech Diamond Shards instead of nuggets in stoked crucible. Ingot recipe w/ iron and creeper oysters is untouched.

- BWM potion brewing options disabled, but it's not a well-researched decision.
- BWM HC fishing turned off because bait seems too much work.
- BWM HC gloom disabled because I don't want the damage effects in darkness, and the "sanity" mechanic is already taken care of.
- BWM, reenabled the removal of the Bone Meal crafting grid recipe. I think it might be overwritten by pyrotech anyway, but eh.
- Changed the spoilage time for spider eyes.
- Changed the spoilage time for all salted foods, plus XLFM's butter.
- Disabled spoilage for SaltyMod's jarred foods and Corned Beef.

Scripts:
- PVJ Red Sandstone rocks and Mossy Cobblestone rocks have been disabled because there aren't Pyrotech things to assign as drops.
