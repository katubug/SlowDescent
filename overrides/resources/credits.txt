For the alert sound, I used an edited version of this:

For the loading screen and main menu background, I used as a base a piece called "pixel forest" by Dmitrii. Website: https://chuckchee.com/

Additional graphics were edited using photopea.com and pixilart.com, both of which I highly recommend.

Some effects were generated with the utilities at minecraft.tools.

The font for the main title/logo is called 8-Bit Limit, and can be found here: https://fonts2u.com/8-bit-limit-o-brk.font
