- Leather: Attack knockback increased 1x
- Wool: Warms player up a fair amount.
- Bone: Slowfall effect.
- Mud: Increases dig speed. Cools player down a bit.

Tier 2:
- Tanned Leather: Attack knockback increased 0.5x
- Jelled Slime: Cools player down a fair amount.
- Swine: Already has set bonus.

Tier 3:
- Iron: Magnetism. Magic shielding.

Tier 5:
- Diamond: Attack damage, Leeching.

Tier 6:
- Ashen: Ember Discount, movement speed, slowfall.

ETC:
- Pajamas: Allow sleep without rain, but also makes player sleepy (no jumping, vulnerable to attacks). Warms player up a bit.
- Wrought Helmet: Could do pushing (intimidation?) or extend reach, or maybe attack boost. However, should have a periodic negative effect, like blindness maybe? Or slowness, nausea, lightning, rust?
