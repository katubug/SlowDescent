Going to leave most of these be, because they shouldn't be spawning in the Misty World and their spawn rules are fine otherwise. The ones I am changing are:

- Dweller: lower level of MW (below y20). In overworld, underground in cold/wet biomes.
- Ashen: lower level of MW (below y20). In overworld, underground in dry/hot biomes.
- Wraith: lower level of MW. Otherwise, only in Nether and on SoulSand.

Mystical Wildlife:
-----
- Vrontosaurus: cold and mountainous biomes
- Dusk Lurkers: forests, spawn only at night

- verdant cicapteras: forests, and more in the spring
- wintry cicapteras: cold biomes and during the winter
- sandy cicapteras: deserts and hot biomes, more during the summer
